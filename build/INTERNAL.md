Final Grid it's a css library to position elements
easily, it's works by using float left elements linked 
to auto described positions

### Understanding the order
each div goes from left to right then from top to button then left to right 

in these example we put one div on side of each other, these lib don't use margins,padding 
or what ever , since its consider hard to understand, to create margins, just create an 
empty div between divs

### Horizontal centralizing a div 
to centralize a div horizontally just create a container, then set 2 empty divs in the
middle of it, with the half percent of the rest of the div size
